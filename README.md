# Todolist v1.0

## Introduction

This is a todolist project I created by implementing a Restfull API using the node js javascript runtime and the Restfull API Express JS framework.

Below is more complete API documentation :

- URL : https://todolist-eta-coral.vercel.app
- [USER API](https://github.com/cybersafellc/todolist/blob/main/docs/USER.md)
- [LIST API](https://github.com/cybersafellc/todolist/blob/main/docs/LIST.md)

This project is wide open for those who want to use my api (for the need to learn frontend consuming api for example) with any frontend framework. Please use it.
